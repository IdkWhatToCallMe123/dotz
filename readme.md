# ‚ö†Ô∏è HEADS UP!!!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è

Some of the extensions and the theme are incompatible/broken on the latest GNOME version (GNOME 45)

************************PLEASE DON‚ÄôT UPDATE TO THE LATEST GNOME VERSION IF YOU WANNA USE THIS SETUP!!!************************

THAT ALSO MEANS DON‚ÄôT UPGRADE TO THE LATEST FEDORA VERSION OR THE LATEST UBUNTU VERSION AS THEY BOTH USE THE GNOME 45

Expect some significant performance and battery life downgrades when using all of the extensions, especially on a laptop. If you still want this setup but without any significant sacrifices disable the Rounded Window Corners extension and the Blur My Shell extension.

Also, expect that some apps might look weird as GTK theming is not an officially supported feature

## A tiny message before the actual tutorial (I'm sorry)

### THIS PAGE IS NOWHERE DONE!!!!!

also:

If you feel like anything is lacking or unclear, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask me! I also constantly struggle with installing stuff myself cuz I'm a fat idiot.

**Also to the more seasoned Linux users:** I don‚Äôt know much coding or how to write these dot file page-whatever. I use Linux mainly because I have apps that I like that work better/only on Linux and also because Windows is a buggy and laggy mess.

If you have some feedback on how I can improve stuff pls lemme me know

üí° Extra note:
I disabled the Stylish on-screen display as it broke some OSD popups from some other extension I use

</aside>

### Blur My Shell

1. Turn **********************everything********************** off except for application blur.
2. Add your desired apps to the list (In my case it was only the terminal)
    
    Note: Since the ‚ÄúAdd Window‚Äù is kinda broken (at least for me), we have to manually figure out what the application that we wanna blur is called.
    
    - If your application is installed through your package manager:
        
        List your installed packages (google it if you don‚Äôt know how to) and find the name of your application, then paste it into Blur My Shell (I think it‚Äôs done this way idk since was too lazy to try this, tell me if it doesn‚Äôt work)
        
    - If your application is installed through Flatpak:
        
        Find your app on [https://flathub.org](https://flathub.org) and click on the drop-down arrow next to the Install button. Copy the last part of the command (doesn‚Äôt matter which one) and paste it into Blur My Shell!
        
    - If your application is installed through Snap:
        
        Idk how to do it bc I don't use snap oops pls tell me if you know how to do it and I'll put it here :)

# How to spice up the terminal

<aside>
üí° To make fish your default shell follow this guide: https://askubuntu.com/a/26459/
*Also not all commands in Fish are exactly the same as in Bash. If you encounter any trouble you can just start Bash in your terminal and continue there*

</aside>

1. Then pepper a bit of this: [https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)
2. Then make it cool with this: h[ttps://github.com/catppuccin/fish](https://github.com/catppuccin/fish)
3. To get the ****************E P I C**************** icons install a font of your choice: [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
    
    (I personally used FiraCode :D)
    
4. Install Black Box (the terminal app) 
    
    [Flathub link](https://flathub.org/sv/apps/com.raggesilver.BlackBox)
    
5. Toggle these:

    - General ‚Üí Header Bar ‚Üí Floating Controls ‚Üí Show Floating Controls: ****ON****

6. To install the theme:
    
    1.  Download one of these: [https://github.com/catppuccin/tilix/tree/main/src](https://github.com/catppuccin/tilix/tree/main/src)
    
    1. Under Terminal‚ÜíTheme click the folder icon
    2. Copy the previously downloaded. JSON file and put it in the ******************Schemes****************** folder
    3. Restart ****************Black Box****************
    4. Navigate back to the theme settings and select your theme
    5. Assuming you configured **********************Blur My Shell**********************  properly (mentioned in the previous section) your terminal should look something like this now:

sudo chown you-user-name /var/lib/flatpak/app/com.spotify.Client/x86_64/stable/active/files/extra/share/
