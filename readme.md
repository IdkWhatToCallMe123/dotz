üí° Extra note:

</aside>

### Blur My Shell

1. Turn **********************everything********************** off except for application blur.
2. Add your desired apps to the list (In my case it was only the terminal)
    
    Note: Since the ‚ÄúAdd Window‚Äù is kinda broken (at least for me), we have to manually figure out what the application that we wanna blur is called.
    
    - If your application is installed through you package manager:
        
        List your installed packages (google it if you don‚Äôt know how to) and find the name of your application, then paste it into Blur My Shell (I think it‚Äôs done this way idk since was too lazy to try this, tell me if it doesn‚Äôt work)
        
    - If your application is installed through Flatpak:
        
        Find your app on [https://flathub.org](https://flathub.org) and click on the drop-down arrow next to the Install button. Copy the last part of the command (doesn‚Äôt matter which one) and paste it into Blur My Shell!
        
    - If your application is installed through Snap:
        
        Idk how to do it bc i dont use snap oops pls tell me if you know how to do it and ill put it here :)
