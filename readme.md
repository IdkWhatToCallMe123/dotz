# ‚ö†Ô∏è HEADS UP!!!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è

Some of the extensions and the theme are incompatible/broken on the latest GNOME version (GNOME 45)

************************PLEASE DON‚ÄôT UPDATE TO THE LATEST GNOME VERSION IF YOU WANNA USE THIS SETUP!!!************************

THAT ALSO MEANS DON‚ÄôT UPGRADE TO THE LATEST FEDORA VERSION OR THE LATEST UBUNTU VERSION AS THEY BOTH USE THE GNOME 45

## A tiny message before the actual tutorial (im sorry)

### THIS PAGE IS NOWHERE DONE!!!!!

also:

If you feel like anything is lacking or unclear, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask me! I also constantly struggle with installing stuff my self cuz im fat idiot.

**Also to the more seasoned linux users:** I don‚Äôt really know much coding or how to write these dot file page-whatevers. I use linux mainly because i have apps that I like that works better/only on Linux and also because windows is a buggy and laggy mess.

If you have some feedback on how i can improve stuff pls lemme know

## The extensions that require a bit of extra configuration:

<aside>
üí° Extra note:
I disabled the Stylish on screen display as it broke some OSD popups from some other extension I use

</aside>

### Blur My Shell

1. Turn **********************everything********************** off except for application blur.
2. Add your desired apps to the list (In my case it was only the terminal)
    
    Note: Since the ‚ÄúAdd Window‚Äù is kinda broken (at least for me), we have to manually figure out what the application that we wanna blur is called.
    
    - If your application is installed through you package manager:
        
        List your installed packages (google it if you don‚Äôt know how to) and find the name of your application, then paste it into Blur My Shell (I think it‚Äôs done this way idk since was too lazy to try this, tell me if it doesn‚Äôt work)
        
    - If your application is installed through Flatpak:
        
        Find your app on [https://flathub.org](https://flathub.org) and click on the drop-down arrow next to the Install button. Copy the last part of the command (doesn‚Äôt matter which one) and paste it into Blur My Shell!
        
    - If your application is installed through Snap:
        
        Idk how to do it bc i dont use snap oops pls tell me if you know how to do it and ill put it here :)

# How to spice up the terminal

1. Install a little bit of this: [https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)

<aside>
üí° To make fish your default shell follow this guide: [https://askubuntu.com/a/26459](https://askubuntu.com/a/26459)
*Also not all commands in fish are exactly the same as in Bash. If you encounter any trouble you can just start Bash in your terminal and continue there*

4. Install Black Box (the terminal app) 
    
    link: [https://flathub.org/sv/apps/com.raggesilver.BlackBox](https://flathub.org/sv/apps/com.raggesilver.BlackBox)
